# Age-and-Gender-Prediction
### Using Convolutional Neural Network
Implementation of paper [Age and Gender Classification using Convolutional Neural Network (June, 2015)](http://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/projects/cnn_agegender/CNN_AgeGenderEstimation.pdf)
using __caffe__.
Predictions of Age and Gender utilizing AI have versatile applications, spanning intelligent human-machine interaction, security, cosmetics and e-commerce. By employing OpenCV, this project can determine the age and gender of a person in real time.

## Requisites
__1. Caffe (Deep Learning Library)__  
__2. openCV (Computer Vision Library)__
